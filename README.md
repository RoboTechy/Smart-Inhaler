# Smart-Inhaler
Smart Inhaler Device

This smart inhaler helps patients, such as those suffering from asthma, take their medication correctly. I have built the electronic components but have not yet attached them to an actual inhaler.

The electronic board consists of an ARM F103 microcontroller and an MPU6050 sensor to detect shaking. The device has three LEDs:

The first LED turns on when the patient shakes the inhaler three times in a vertical direction.
After a short delay, the second LED turns on, indicating that the patient can inhale.
Finally, when the third LED turns on, the patient can exhale.
This device is also equipped with a Bluetooth module, allowing it to send data to a smart device. The collected data can then be used by doctors to monitor their patients.
All necessary drawing and data is in the compressed file attached to this project.
